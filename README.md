# PyCalc
This is my very first completed project after 7 years of not programming. This project is (obviously) not the most impressive, however it marks my step out of tutorial purgatory and into making real progress to my coding abilities.

Also PLEASE read the README.txt for more information.

If you see any flaws you want to say  (I still don't fully understand github quite yet) knock yourself out.
